# MOOC Student Engagement and Dropout Analysis

This repository presents an in-depth data analysis of student engagement in the **Cyber Security: Safety At Home, Online, and in Life** MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), offered by Newcastle University on the FutureLearn platform. The analysis follows the **CRISP-DM** methodology across two data mining cycles, aimed at understanding patterns of student behavior, course completion, and attrition.

---

## Project Overview

- **Report File**: `AnalysisReport.pdf`  
- **Dataset**: Raw enrollment and interaction data from 7 course runs  

---

## Objective

The objective is to analyze demographic and behavioral data to identify:

- Key factors influencing **course completion**, **purchase decisions**, and **dropout**
- Patterns in **student engagement** over time and across course runs
- Opportunities for improving **course design**, **retention**, and **purchase conversion rates**

---

## Methodology

The study is structured using the **CRISP-DM** framework:

### Round 1:
- **Business Understanding**: Define research questions and success criteria
- **Data Understanding**: Explore and assess raw data across multiple files
- **Data Preparation**: Construct a cleaned master dataset from 7 course runs
- **Modeling**: Analyze engagement by country, gender, age, employment, education, and archetype
- **Evaluation**: Summarize key trends and actionable insights

### Round 2:
- **Focused Exploration** on dropout reasons, step completion, and purchase behavior
- **Boxplots** and **correlation analysis** for user behavior
- **Engagement metrics** (purchase rate, completion step, leaving reasons)

---

## Key Findings

- **Participation Rate**: Only **5.8%** of learners actively participated
- **Purchase Rate**: Just **0.8%** purchased certificates; among completers, the rate was **13.4%**
- **Top Dropout Reasons**: Lack of time, course not meeting expectations
- **Median Completion**: Users stopped at step ~13 / week 1
- **Engagement Trends**:
  - Highest participation from UK, India, US, Nigeria, and South Africa
  - Slight male majority but increasing gender diversity
  - Diverse educational and employment backgrounds
  - “Vitalisers” were the most common learner archetype

## Insights & Recommendations

- **Improve Retention**: Redesign early course steps to maintain interest beyond week 1
- **Boost Conversions**: Emphasize certificate value; simplify purchase process
- **Demographic Strategy**: Tailor outreach to emerging markets (e.g. Nigeria, South Africa)
- **Adaptive Learning**: Address dropout triggers (time constraints, unclear expectations)
